Some notes on the current implementation:

The WiFi receive checking is not robust
a '!' must be at the start of the buffer when a '*' is received.
a '*' will cause the buffer to be reset
the command board sends a '#' before the '!' to help make sure comm is working right
change the command board to send a '*' and things start to work well
this causes the WiFi to clear the buffer right before the '!' is sent
this should be cleaned up with more robust code to look for '!' before starting to buffer
many other places in code look for '!' before starting to buffer, so this should be easy
